Chapter 1: Introduction to Photosynthesis

What is Photosynthesis?
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight into chemical energy.

The Equation
The basic equation for photosynthesis is:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Key Components:
1. Chlorophyll - The green pigment that captures light
2. Carbon dioxide - Absorbed from air through stomata
3. Water - Absorbed through roots
4. Sunlight - Provides energy for the reaction

Example 1: Leaf Structure
A typical leaf has several layers designed for efficient photosynthesis. The upper epidermis allows light to enter, while the mesophyll cells contain most chloroplasts.

Practice Questions:
1. What are the raw materials needed for photosynthesis?
2. What is produced during photosynthesis?
3. Why are leaves green?
